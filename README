RailsDevBoostConcernedWithFix
==========================

Fixes an incompatibility between a concerned_with[http://github.com/jakehow/concerned_with] and rails-dev-boost[http://github.com/thedarkone/rails-dev-boost] plugins.

Usage
=======

The plugin needs to be loaded after both the concerned_with and rails-dev-boost plugins (that is what Rails will do by default).
